			<h2>Services We Can Provide</h2>
			<h3>Getting You A New Mattress</h3>
				<p>The Jolly Pegasus, being the amazing mattress company it is, can,
				believe it or not, provide customers with amazing mattresses! Our mattresses can ship within the
				next 90 days but may take 91 days in the case of a backup in mattresses. Here are some of the mattresses we provide:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Super Duper Mattress: a mattress that the giants up the beanstalk could sleep in!
					<br><img id="mat1" src="images/mat.jpg" alt="Mattress">$40000<br><br></li>
					
					<li>The Boring Regular: a mattress that is normal... why would you buy this one?
					<br><img id="mat2" src="images/mat2.jpg" alt="Mattress">$99999<br><br></li>
					
					<li>The Crazy Mattress: a mattress that changes shape as you sleep. We don't know what ghost lives in it!
					<br><img id="mat3" src="images/mat3.jpeg" alt="Mattress">$0 (please take it from us)<br><br></li>
					
					<li>The Matt-stress: a mattress that slowly stresses you out more as you sleep.
					<br><img id="mat4" src="images/mat4.jpg" alt="Mattress">$6<br></li>
				</ul>
			<h4>Fixing Mattresses</h4>
				<p>Got hole-y, funny-shaped, or just plain bad mattress? Send yours in
				for $82 dollars and we'll have it back to you within 3 years all fixed up!
				<p>
			<h5>Buying Mattresses From You!</h5>
