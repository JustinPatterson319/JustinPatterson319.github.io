We do almost every activity within the game, including Gambit, Grandmaster Strikes, Iron Banner, Trials of Osiris, and Raids. <br><br> We all take great pride in the fact we like to have fun, while also getting rewarded for the experience. We enjoy players who don't try to gatekeep others from having a good time,and seek to make sure everyone is enjoying themselves. <br><br> Getting along, having a good laugh, and kicking some butt with our space magic is all you need to be a member of the clan.
