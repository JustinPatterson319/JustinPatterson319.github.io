		<h3>Frequently Asked Questions</h3>
		<p>You've got questions. We've got answers.</p><hr>
		<ol>
			<li>
			Does your team recruitment have any sort of process or challenge you expect to see from a newbie?
				<ul>
				<li>Not at all. We'll play with anyone so long as you can read the room and don't act like jerk!
				We also will help players that may not be as skilled as others. Getting through things with
				people you enjoy playing with is all part of the game!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
			Do you guys play gamemodes outside of PvP often? Or are you a PvP/Trials focused group?
				<ul>
				<li>We enjoy every part of this game. Some of us lean more towards PvP than others, but we all
				partake in any content Destiny has to offer. We particularly enjoy Iron Banner, Raids, and dungeons!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				Does anyone in your clan enjoy playing games outside of Destiny? If so, what?
				<ul>
				<li>Most of us play a lot of games outside of Destiny. Some games we play together include Call
				of Duty, Minecraft, Monster Hunter and Super Smash Bros. We also all enjoy a variety of solo games
				that include Kingdom Hearts, Hollow Knight, Jak and Daxter, Horizon: Zero Dawn, and Doom.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<br>
			<li>
				How long have you all actually known each other for? Do you meet in real life at all?
				<ul>
				<li>All of us have met at some point in time. Some of us are related, others are neighbors. A few are fellow
				teachers, and some are just really good friends. We all know each other, through each other.</li>
				</ul>
