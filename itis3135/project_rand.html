		<h2>Project Design</h2>
		<h3>Project Overview</h3>
			<p>
				The site I will be making will be for my friend Andrew, called Trials and Error: Fireteam Finder. He enjoys playing Destiny 2, specifically the Trials of Osiris
				activity, but can sometimes not get people to come and play with him. The site will be a way for him to promote his team 
				and to get new members so he can have more allies to take to the fight! My intention is to have the website show off Andrew's teams, "Team Avatar" and
				"LetsJustWipeGuys", demonstrate the skills the team has, information on its members, when the teams play, and
				information such as what kind of teamates they will be looking for. 
			</p>
		<h3>Intended Users</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>Destiny Players</li>
				<li>Esports Competitors</li>
				<li>Competitive Gaming Communities</li>
				<li>Bungie Developers</li>
			</ul>
			
			<br>
		<h3>Client Information</h3>

				<figcaption>Page will be a welcome page, have our links, some images that will lead to more, and will have some interactive things like polls</figcaption>

		<h3>Page Designs</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Home
					<ul>
						<li>
							This page is to welcome users who access the site. It will contain a basic summary of the site, providing some
							of the information present on other pages and will have alternate links to get to those pages. Some surveys 
							will be present on this page about fun stuff like what the users favorite weapon is in Destiny. There may be a
							hyperlink for the teams introduction video on this page. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Meet The Team
					<ul>
						<li>
							This page will be used to introduce core members of the team so the user gets an idea of what they are like to play with.
							This will contain player information, what they like about the game, a little about them in real life, and will contain
							a few images and possibly videos. Users won't enter data here. A drop down could be used to cycle through the team in the
							case the page is looking too cluttered. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Team Requirements
					<ul>
						<li>
							This page will tell a user what is being looked for in a new recruit. This page will have some questions regarding the player, and
							would be the main page for reaching out about this team. Users would need to enter a variety of data, and would need validation. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Clips and Images
					<ul>
						<li>
							This page will contain images and videos of things the team has done that can help show they are both skillful within 
							the game as well as fun to play with at the same time. This page won't have the user do anything other than sit back and enjoy
							the content. 
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>When We Play
					<ul>
						<li>
							This will give the user a general idea on the team's schedule (this is being debated to move over to Meet The Team)
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>View Stats
					<ul>
						<li>
							This will be the teams numbers. The user can click buttons to view different stats of the team, checking to see
							how they statistically perform. It will also provide links to sources outside the site like Destiny Tracker, which
							keeps up with stats as well.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
				<li>Questions/Forums
					<ul>
						<li>
							This will provide more information based on questions that are frequently asked in the Destiny community. It will
							also help provide updates and provide a link to the Destiny 2 forums. The user may also submit questions of their own.
						</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ol>


			
			<br>
		<h3>Dynamic Functionality</h3>
			<p>
				Forms will be present throughout, asking the user for information that can be fun like they're favorite parts of the game (Home page),
				but can also ask for practical information or have the user ask questions (Team Requirements, Questions).
				Photos will be present throughout but mostly on the Home and Clips pages. The photos will be cycleable for less clustering.
				The user can access stats by clicking buttons present on the Stats page.
