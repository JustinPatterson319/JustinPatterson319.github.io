		<h2>Website Evaluations</h2>
		
		<section>
			<h3>
				<a href="https://www.pennyjuice.com/">Bad Website: Penny Juice</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				This website features juice concentrate that is specifically made for childcare centers.
				The site provides information on the company, how the ordering process works,
				and all the kinds of juice that can be ordered. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Contrast: The site actually does a relatively okay job with its contrast. Because the site
				is so simple, the black text on top of solid brighter backgrounds makes it easy to read. Despite this,
				the main desciption of the product on the page can get a little lost as it blue text on an image with
				a lot of blue in it. </li>
				<li> Repitition: The site tries to utilize a few colors, but as you explore you will see random other colors
				separated throughout. The main yellow and blue color scheme is sometimes joined by random reds and greens
				here and there. Going page to page also shows that there is differing structures to text as you view each one. 
				Images can also be helpful to the page, and in pther instances just take up space.</li>
				<li> Alignment: Alignment has a solid structure on the home page, but as you explore lead
				to you seeing that everything is prety much just alligned to the left from then on out with images sometimes
				taking up the empty space on the right hand side. However, images mostly also occupy the left-hand side
				alongside the text.</li>
				<li> Proximity: The pages lack of detail, short paragraphs, and small images lead to their being a lot of blank space on the page.
				Text elements are not too close together, but the page can still feel a little hollow in its design because of this extreme space.</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h3>
				<a href="https://openbionics.com/bionic-heroes/">Good Website: Open Bionics</a>
			</h3>
			<p>
				This website showcases the "Hero Arm", a product designed amputees to be a cheaper,
				and more reliable prosthetic that can also be stylish as well. The site displays many users
				of the Hero Arm, as well as the functions of it, its creators, and how you can get one of your own. 
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li> Contrast: The website does a good job at using both light and dark colors when appropriate.
				Light text is used over dark background and vice versa. Everything tends to stand out and nothing appears to be
				hard to look at. Everything maintains a uniqueness while maintaining structure.</li>
				<li> Repitition: The page keeps a consistent setup, using a white, black, blue, and purple color scheme
				consistently. The format of each page is also in unison and images are shown alongside each text
				that add to what information is being displayed.</li>
				<li> Alignment: Each page can have varying alignment, but it still gives off a uniform strucutre that flows well.
				Images are aligned with every text element, allowing for the website to easily inform the viewer of its
				product by both the text and images used. All objects on the page feel connected and important.</li>
				<li> Proximity: The uniformity of the page makes everything stand out in a good way. Everything is given
				plenty of breathing room, but not enough to make the site feel empty at any point.</li>
			</ul>
